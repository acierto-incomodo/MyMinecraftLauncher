----TUTORIAL----
Amethyst is a dark-purple Minecraft launcher packaged as a native **Electron
desktop application**. Its Node.js backend and zero-build HTML/CSS/JavaScript
UI run together inside the app, so Windows users can launch Amethyst from an
installer or a portable `.exe` without installing Node.js.

> **Legal Disclaimer:** Amethyst does not include or redistribute Minecraft client code, libraries, assets, or other copyrighted game materials. Upon installation or execution, the launcher retrieves Mojang's public version manifest and downloads official files directly from Mojang/Microsoft servers to the user's local machine. Amethyst Studios does **not**provide unauthorized game copies, nor do we support or condone software piracy.

> **Security note:** Amethyst binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) only. Do **not** port
> forward the launcher's port to the internet. The backend has no authentication
> and exposes full control over the local system (file access, process launch,
> Java downloads, etc.). Exposing it publicly would allow remote code execution.

## Install on Windows

Download the correct installer for your system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MinLOL12/Amethyst/releases):

- **x64** (most Intel/AMD PCs): `Amethyst-Launcher-Setup-*-x64.exe``
- ARM64 (Snapdragon X, Surface Pro 11, etc.): Amethyst-Launcher-Setup-*-arm64.exe

Portable (no-install) versions are also available for both architectures.

> If you see "This app can't run on your PC," make sure you downloaded the correct architecture for your device. Check your system type under **Settings → System → About → Device specifications → System type**.
## Install on Linux

Download the correct package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MinLOL12/Amethyst/releases):

- **AppImage**: Download the  file, make it executable, and run it.
- **Debian (.deb)**: Download the  file and install it using your package manager.

## Install on macOS

Download the  file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MinLOL12/Amethyst/releases):

1. Open the  file.
2. Drag the Amethyst Launcher icon into your **Applications** folder.
3. To open the app for the first time, you may need to right-click the app and select **Open**, or go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**, as the build is currently unsigned.

## Run from source

Contributors need Node.js 22.12 or newer:

```bash
npm ci
npm start          # Electron desktop app
npm run start:web  # optional browser-hosted development mode
```

The Electron app starts its backend on an unused `127.0.0.1` port and displays
the complete launcher in its own secured window. Browser mode prints its local
URL and opens the system browser.

Useful environment variables:

```bash
AMETHYST_HOME=/path/to/data npm start       # store data somewhere else
AMETHYST_NO_OPEN=1 npm run start:web        # do not open a browser automatically
PORT=8080 npm run start:web                 # use a fixed browser-mode port
AMETHYST_MS_CLIENT_ID=your-entra-public-client-id npm start  # optional OAuth client
# Optional with a custom sovereign-cloud/authority registration:
AMETHYST_MS_DEVICE_CODE_URL=https://authority/devicecode AMETHYST_MS_TOKEN_URL=https://authority/token npm start
```

The web UI is intentionally just the files in `public/`: it starts quickly,
works anywhere Node.js runs, and can be customized without a build step.

## UI

The browser UI is designed to feel like a polished desktop launcher while
keeping the implementation simple:

- Responsive glassy dark-purple interface with inline SVG iconography.
- Overview dashboard with quick launch, runtime status, recent activity, news,
  and file shortcuts.
- Instance browser with isolated profiles and per-instance settings.
- Searchable official release and snapshot browser.
- Offline and Microsoft account profiles.
- Java detection and managed Java downloads.
- Live download queue, speed, ETA, install, launch, and log feedback.
- Keyboard navigation (`1`–`4`) and mobile navigation.

To change the look, edit `public/index.html` and `public/styles.css`. To change
behavior, edit `public/app.js`; the Node server automatically serves those
files. No build command is needed.

## Features

### Microsoft account login and skins

- Multiple Microsoft and offline accounts.
- Device-code OAuth without an embedded password form.
- Remember login with refresh tokens.
- Switch accounts without reauthenticating when a session is stored.
- Change a Microsoft account's official Java Edition skin from the Accounts page.
- Preview classic/slim and legacy skin PNGs before applying them.
- Import a local PNG, a direct HTTPS PNG URL, or a NameMC / The Skindex skin page; quick links are also provided for Planet Minecraft and Nova Skin.

Offline accounts cannot publish an official skin because Minecraft's profile service requires an authenticated, game-owning Microsoft account. For offline accounts, use a client-side skin mod such as **CustomSkinLoader** (Fabric/Forge/NeoForge/Quilt) to load custom skins from a local file or skin server.

### Installations and instances

- Create multiple profiles with isolated game directories.
- Configure per-instance Java versions and custom JVM arguments.
- Use different Minecraft versions and loaders per instance.
- Rename, duplicate, delete, export, and import instances as ZIP files.

### Mod loaders

- Fabric
- Forge
- NeoForge
- Quilt
- Vanilla

Forge and NeoForge modpacks use isolated game directories. Before the official installer runs, Amethyst creates a compatible `launcher_profiles.json` inside the instance, so the installer does not incorrectly ask the user to run Mojang's launcher first.

### Java manager
### Java Manager

To ensure a smooth gaming experience, you must install the appropriate Java Development Kit (JDK) version required by the specific Minecraft release you intend to play. Compatibility varies significantly between game versions:

*   **Version Compatibility:** Newer Minecraft releases generally require newer Java versions (e.g., Minecraft 1.20+ typically requires Java 17 or 21). Conversely, older versions of the game will only function with older Java releases (such as Java 8 or 11).
*   **Recommended Distribution:** We recommend using [Adoptium (Eclipse Temurin)]([#####################]) as your primary source for Java, as it provides reliable and pre-built binaries for all major operating systems.
*   **Version Mismatch:** If you don't install the correct version, the launcher will throw an error explaining that you do not have the Java version required to launch your modpack/version of the game.
### Downloads, settings, and logs

- Queue downloads with progress, speed, and estimated time remaining.
- Configure RAM, resolution, fullscreen, JVM arguments, and launch arguments.
- View live game logs, search logs, copy output, and inspect crash reports.
- Open instance folders, saves, mods, screenshots, resource packs, logs, and
  crash reports from the launcher.

### Official Minecraft files

Amethyst downloads and verifies official Minecraft game files directly from Mojang's metadata, including the client JAR, libraries, native binaries, asset indexes, and asset objects. Please note that this software does not grant a Minecraft license; users are required to comply with the Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA) and all other applicable terms of service.

## Data and file structure

## Development and packaging

```bash
npm test
npm run pack         # unpacked app for the current platform
npm run build:win    # NSIS installer + portable Windows .exe
npm run build:linux  # AppImage + Debian package
npm run build:mac    # macOS DMG (run on macOS for signing)
```

Windows packages are built automatically on pushes to `main`. The workflow
uploads both `.exe` files as build artifacts and attaches them to GitHub
releases. Release builds are currently unsigned, so Windows may display a
SmartScreen warning until a code-signing certificate is configured.

The legacy `build/installer.nsh` customization file is intentionally disabled in
`package.json` because electron-builder auto-loads it by default and it breaks
CI packaging for the current Windows release workflow. The NSIS installer also
uses a dedicated plain-text `build/license.txt` resource so the Windows build
does not depend on the repository's root `LICENSE` file format.

## MVP limitations

- Microsoft authentication requires a configured Azure application client ID
  when the default client is unavailable.
- Offline accounts cannot join servers that require authenticated Microsoft
  sessions.
- The launcher downloads official files but does not include or redistribute
  Minecraft code or assets.
